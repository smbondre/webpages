    <h2>Here is a little bit about me</h2>    
 <hr/>
  
  <p>Hello. My name is Saabiq Bondre. I intend to major in Biomedical Engineering.
  I have always had an interest in engineering and believe that processes in nature hold the key to the most efficient solutions to engineering problems.
  I most likely want to focus on genome editing and it's medical applications.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p class="paragraph_2">I have worked in <ins>customer service</ins> at Harris Teeter. I have also done some management and training of other workers. 
  My dream job is to work in <strong>research</strong> and development for a biotechnology company.
  I am <em>interested</em> in both genetic editing and prosthetics and neural connections.
  <p/>
